Once upon a time, the little red riding hood decides to visit her grandmother. So she brings some snacks and cakes with her. Unfortunately, she met the timber wolf on the way to her grandma's house.

The wolf, seemingly friendly enough, seemed the type that would try to impersonate her grandmother. Little red riding hood found this wolf very suspicious.

Little Red Riding Hood stayed on guard before entering her grandmother's house. She didn't want to be eaten. She entered her grandmother's house and walked up to the bed to surprise her.
